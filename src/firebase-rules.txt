üî• FIREBASE FIRESTORE SECURITY RULES FOR FLINT APP
==================================================

CRITICAL: You MUST apply these rules to your Firebase Console to fix the permission errors.

üìç How to Apply These Rules:
1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select your "flint-5cbda" project  
3. Click "Firestore Database" in the left sidebar
4. Click the "Rules" tab at the top
5. Replace ALL the content with the rules below
6. Click "Publish" to save the changes

‚ö†Ô∏è  IMPORTANT: Without these rules, you'll continue getting "Missing or insufficient permissions" errors!

COPY THE RULES BELOW TO YOUR FIREBASE CONSOLE:
=====================================================

rules_version = '2';

service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    
    // Allow users to read and write their own user document
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Allow users to read and write their own subcollections
    match /users/{userId}/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Optional: Allow public read access to user profiles (remove if you want full privacy)
    // match /users/{userId} {
    //   allow read: if true;
    //   allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    // }
  }
}

=====================================================

üìã ADDITIONAL FIREBASE SETUP CHECKLIST:

1. ‚úÖ Apply the Firestore Rules above
2. ‚úÖ Enable Authentication:
   - Go to "Authentication" ‚Üí "Sign-in method"
   - Enable "Email/Password" provider
   - Save changes

3. ‚úÖ Optional - Enable Google Sign-in:
   - In "Sign-in method", also enable "Google" 
   - This gives users more login options

4. ‚úÖ Test the rules:
   - After applying rules, try creating a new account in your Flint app
   - The "Missing permissions" error should be gone

üéØ WHAT THESE RULES DO:
- Users can only access their own data (privacy-first!)
- Authenticated users can create, read, update, and delete their own user document
- No one can access other users' data
- Perfect for a privacy-first note-taking app like Flint

üîß TROUBLESHOOTING:
If you still get permission errors after applying these rules:
1. Make sure you clicked "Publish" after pasting the rules
2. Wait 30 seconds for the rules to propagate globally
3. Try refreshing your Flint app
4. Check the Firebase Console logs for any rule parsing errors

Once you apply these rules, your Flint app will have full Firebase authentication working! üöÄ
